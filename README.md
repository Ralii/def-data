# def-data

Describe data with malli and get accessor def's generated automatically.

NOTE: Only works for Clojurescript currently. I intend to use this for re-frame db and iterate from there. Still early phases and subject to change.

## Installation

TODO Clojars publish


## Examples

``` clojure
(def-data name base-key
   [:map
     [:id :int]
     [:name :string]])

 ->>>

  (def name
    [:map
     [:id :int]
     [:name :string]])
 
  (def name->id [:base-key :id])
  (def name->name [:base-key :name])

```

### Advantage
Accessors will always match the schema structure. If schema changes def's wont exist and with lsp support editor will complain all the locations where previous def's were used.
  
### Limitations
Does not support predicate macros in schema. For example `string?`.
